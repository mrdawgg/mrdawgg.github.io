	<h2>About Mr. Dawgg</h2>
	<p>I am an 18 year old who's dream is to be able to make a living off of one of my favorite things in the world, which is playing video games and making content.</p>
	<p>I attempted streaming, and youtube many times as a kid but could never get off the ground until now. Thanks to tiktok I was able to amass thousands of views and advertise my accounts.</p>
	<p>My goal is to be able to branch off of Call of Duty and begin recording my friends and I's nightly convos while we play, because there is lot of entertainment there.</p>
	<p>I know 2 things that set me apart from other streamers and youtubers, first, I want to make diverse content to bring entertainment all the time, and secondly, I KNOW no streamer hand made their own website, I mean this took me literally days, so I think they deserves a follow.</p>
	<p>On a serious note though, if you enjoyed this page and the content feel free to drop a follow, and help me achieve my goals.</p>
